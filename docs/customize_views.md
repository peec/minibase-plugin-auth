# View customization

The auth plugin comes with a default views for authentication. These are ment to be overidden in your applications. You should copy the `AuthPlugin` folder in `src/Pkj/Minibase/Plugin/AuthPlugin/views` to your own views folder. After this is done you can customize these views as you go.

All the views extends the `AuthPlugin/template.html` file, this is probably not what you want, instead you may want to extend your own template.html, so you can change this.
